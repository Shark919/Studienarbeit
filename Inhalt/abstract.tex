\chapter*{Abstract} 


Nowadays, in the Digitial Age, businesses have to adopt to the newest
technologies in order to remain at the top. One of the most recent and
significant techical developments  is termed the Internet of Things or short
\emph{IoT}.
This topic involves the digitalization of standard business workflows and
processes in order to automate and improve them in a substantial amount.
\newline The software manufacturer SAP is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany.
Since the buildings are broadly geographically spread, shuttle services are
offered to travel between the locations. \newline This study is therefore
motivated by the research question, to which extend a digitial transformation of
the shuttle service is practical and whether beneficial effects would be
visible.
In order to assess the possible impact of an IoT driven transportation system
this study proposes a prototype that not only covers the relevant requirements
but it is also implemented and tested under real conditions. \newline The
findings uphold the prediction that the innovation of the shuttle services leads
into a wide range of advantages that are indicated by the developed Proof of
Concept. The basic concepts of its architectural design are also
applicable on other topics such as public transportation in general.
